# Data Visualisation - Tableau Dashboard
This is my dashboarding practice on Tableau on King House, Washington house sales dataset. It has been a long time since I did not do any dashboard building exercises with Tableau. I had fun working on it.

I used Mo Chen's https://github.com/mochen862/king-county-house-sales data and his youtube video as a guide.
